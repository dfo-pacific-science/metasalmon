\arguments{
\item{repo}{Repository slug in \code{"owner/name"} form to verify access. Specify
the private repository you intend to work with to confirm your PAT has

\description{
Interactive setup wizard that configures authentication for reading CSV files
from private GitHub repositories. This function:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item Checks that git is installed and available
\item Guides creation of a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with \code{repo} scope
if one is not already stored
\item Stores the PAT securely via \code{gitcreds} for future use
\item Verifies that authentication works by testing access to a repository
}

Run this function once before using \code{read_github_csv()} to access private
repositories. The stored PAT will be used automatically for subsequent
requests.

A Personal Access Token (PAT) is a GitHub credential that allows API access.
The \code{repo} scope is required to read from private repositories. Tokens are
stored locally by the \code{gitcreds} package in your system's credential manager.

If your organization uses Single Sign-On (SSO), you may need to authorize
your PAT for that organization at https://github.com/settings/tokens after
creating it.
