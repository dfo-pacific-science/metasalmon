\title{ICES controlled vocabularies (code lists)}
\description{
ICES publishes controlled vocabularies (also called \strong{code lists}: tables of
allowed values like "Gear" codes) via a public REST API.
}
\details{
These are not OWL ontologies; use them for categorical fields and reporting
codes, not for ontology IRIs.
