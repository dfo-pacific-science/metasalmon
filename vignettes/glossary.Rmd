This glossary defines technical terms used throughout the metasalmon documentation in plain English. You don't need to memorize these - refer back here whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term.

## Core Concepts

### Data Package

A folder containing your data files plus a "recipe file" (called `datapackage.json`) that explains what's in them.
Think of it like shipping a box with a detailed packing list - the recipient knows exactly what they're getting.

**Example**: A folder containing:
- `escapement.csv` (your data)
- `datapackage.json` (the recipe/packing list)
- `column_dictionary.csv` (column descriptions)

### Data Dictionary

A table that describes each column in your data - what it means, what type of values it contains, and what units it uses.

**Example**:

| Column | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| POP_ID | Unique population identifier | text |
| SPAWNERS | Estimated spawner count | number |
| YEAR | Survey year | integer |

### Column Role

A category that describes what kind of information a column contains. metasalmon uses these roles:

| Role | What it means | Examples |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **identifier** | Uniquely identifies a record | POP_ID, SITE_CODE |
| **attribute** | Describes a characteristic | STREAM_NAME, SPECIES |
| **measurement** | A numeric observation | SPAWNER_COUNT, TEMPERATURE |
| **temporal** | A date or time | SURVEY_DATE, YEAR |
| **categorical** | A code from a fixed list | RUN_TYPE, QUALITY_FLAG |

### Code List

A table that explains what each code value means for categorical columns.

**Example** for a SPECIES column:

| Code | Label |
|------|-------|
| CO | Coho Salmon |
| CH | Chinook Salmon |
| PK | Pink Salmon |
| SO | Sockeye Salmon |

## Semantic Web Terms

These terms relate to linking your data to standard scientific definitions. **You don't need to understand these to use metasalmon** - they're handled automatically. This section is for those who want to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

### IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)

A web address (like a URL) that points to an official definition of a term. When we say "spawner count" means the same thing across all DFO datasets, we prove it by pointing to a shared IRI.

**Example**: `https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#NaturalSpawnerCount`

Think of it like a library catalog number - it uniquely identifies a specific concept so there's no confusion.

### Ontology

A shared vocabulary where scientists agree on what terms mean - like a specialized dictionary for salmon science. An ontology defines not just terms, but also how they relate to each other.

**Example**: The DFO Salmon Ontology defines terms like "Conservation Unit", "Escapement", and "Run Timing", and explains how they relate (e.g., a Conservation Unit contains multiple Populations).

### SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

A system for organizing vocabulary terms into lists. Used for:
- Code lists (all valid species codes)
- Measurement definitions (what "escapement" means)
- Vocabulary schemes (all run timing categories)

**Plain English**: Think of SKOS as a way to create organized lists with definitions.

### OWL (Web Ontology Language)

A system for defining categories of things and their relationships. Used for:
- Defining what a "Conservation Unit" is
- Saying that "Coho" is a type of "Pacific Salmon"
- Describing that a "Population" belongs to a "Conservation Unit"

**Plain English**: Think of OWL as a classification system, like how biology classifies species into genus, family, order, etc.

### Semantic

"Meaning-aware" - data that carries its definitions with it so computers and humans can understand it the same way.

**Non-semantic data**: A column called `SPAWN_EST` with no explanation
**Semantic data**: The same column linked to a definition that says "Estimated count of naturally spawning adults"

## I-ADOPT Framework

I-ADOPT (InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology) is a framework for precisely describing what a measurement represents. It answers the question: "What exactly did you measure?"

### The Core Components

I-ADOPT defines observable properties using four components:

| Component | Question it answers | Example |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Variable** | What compound concept? | "Sea surface temperature" (the full term) |
| **Property** | What characteristic? | Temperature |
| **Entity** | Of what thing? | Sea surface (water at ocean surface) |
| **Constraint** | Any qualifiers or limits? | Maximum, daily average, etc. |

**Why this matters**: Two researchers might both measure "temperature" but mean different things (air vs. water, surface vs. depth). I-ADOPT removes ambiguity by requiring you to specify exactly what property of what entity you measured.

### Understanding the Components

- **Variable**: The complete, compound term that describes what you measured (e.g., "Natural spawner count"). In metasalmon, this maps to `term_iri`.
- **Property**: The measurable characteristic (e.g., "count", "temperature", "length"). Maps to `property_iri`.
- **Entity**: The thing being measured (e.g., "spawning salmon", "stream water"). Maps to `entity_iri`.
- **Constraint**: Optional qualifiers that narrow the scope (e.g., "maximum", "annual", "wild-origin only"). Maps to `constraint_iri`.

### Units (Not Part of I-ADOPT Core)

While I-ADOPT focuses on describing *what* you measured, you'll also need to record the **units** (how the measurement is expressed). metasalmon includes `unit_iri` for this purpose, typically linking to vocabularies like QUDT.

**Note**: Method (how the measurement was made) is important metadata but is not part of the I-ADOPT framework itself. You can document methods in your column descriptions or other metadata fields.

## Frictionless Data

A standard format for data packages that works across different software and programming languages. metasalmon creates Frictionless-compatible packages, which means:

- Your packages work with Python, R, JavaScript, and other tools
- Other researchers can open your packages without installing metasalmon
- The format follows an international standard (not a DFO-specific format)

## Quick Reference

| Term | One-line definition |
|------|---------------------|
| Data Package | Folder with data + documentation |
| Data Dictionary | Table describing your columns |
| Column Role | What type of information a column contains |
| Code List | Definitions for categorical codes |
| IRI | Web address pointing to a definition |
| Ontology | Shared vocabulary with relationships |
| SKOS | System for organizing term lists |
| OWL | System for classification hierarchies |
| Semantic | Data that carries its meaning with it |
| I-ADOPT | Framework for describing observable properties (variable, property, entity, constraint) |

## Still Confused?

That's okay! The most important terms for getting started are:

1. **Data Package** - what you're creating
2. **Data Dictionary** - what describes your columns
3. **Code List** - what explains your categorical codes

Everything else is handled automatically by metasalmon. You can create excellent, shareable data packages without understanding IRIs, SKOS, OWL, or I-ADOPT.
